# Descent theory

This is the main entry point for the `Descent` library.

The library develops Čech-style descent along a single morphism `p : E ⟶ B`, both for
fibered categories (`pA : 𝒜 ⥤ C` with `pA.IsFibered`) and for pseudofunctors
(`F : LocallyDiscrete Cᵒᵖ ⥤ᵖ Cat`).

`Descent` is the minimal core entry point. For the canonical downstream API surface
that also includes bridge/equivalence compatibility modules, import `Descent.API`.

For the Čech groupoid `Eq(p)`, import `Descent.Cech.Eq`.

To relate the Čech-style pseudofunctor descent data to Mathlib's
`CategoryTheory.Pseudofunctor.DescentData` for a singleton family, import
`Descent.Pseudofunctor.Descent.CechDescentDataEquiv`.
