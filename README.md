Čech-style descent theory in Lean 4/Mathlib [WIP].

Descent along a single morphism `p : E ⟶ B` in a base category with pullbacks, using the overlaps `E ×_B E` and triple overlaps, with unit and cocycle conditions.

Includes parallel development for (1) fibered categories (Grothendieck fibrations) and (2) pseudofunctors `Cᵒᵖ ⥤ᵖ Cat`. The prestack/stack typeclasses are taken directly from Mathlib.

The singleton-cover equivalence file (`Descent/Pseudofunctor/Descent/SingleMorphismEquiv.lean`) is currently WIP and still contains `sorry`.
