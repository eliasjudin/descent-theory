Čech-style descent theory in Lean 4/Mathlib [WIP].

Descent along a single morphism `p : E ⟶ B` in a base category with pullbacks, using the overlaps `E ×_B E` and triple overlaps, with unit and cocycle conditions.

Includes parallel development for (1) fibered categories (Grothendieck fibrations) and (2) pseudofunctors `Cᵒᵖ ⥤ᵖ Cat`, plus equivalences to Mathlib’s descent data for singleton covers and prestack/stack-style comparison results.
