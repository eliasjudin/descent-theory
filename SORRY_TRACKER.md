# Temporary `sorry` Tracker

This file tracks intentional temporary `sorry`s allowed on `main`.

Policy:
- No new `sorry`s without adding an entry here.
- Each entry must state a concrete proof obligation and an exit condition.
- CI permits `declaration uses 'sorry'` warnings only; all other warnings should fail.

## Active entries
- None.
